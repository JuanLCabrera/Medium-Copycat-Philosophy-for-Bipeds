      <h2>What the heck is Philosophy?</h2>
        <p>
          Quite literally, the term "philosophy" means, "love of wisdom." In a broad sense, philosophy is an activity people undertake when they seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to each other. As an academic discipline philosophy is much the same. Those who study philosophy are perpetually engaged in asking, answering, and arguing for their answers to lifeâ€™s most basic questions. To make such a pursuit more systematic academic philosophy is traditionally divided into major areas of study.

      <h2>Some Branches of Philosophy</h2>

          <h3>METAPHYSICS</h3>
            <p>
              Metaphysics is the philosophical branch that studies reality, existence, the nature of being, the physical world, and the universe.
            </p>
          <h3>EPISTEMOLOGY</h3>
            <p>
              Then there’s my favorite branch, Epistemology. So, Epistemology is often referred to as the theory of knowledge. It delves into the definition, scope, and parameters of knowledge and knowledge formation. It seeks to explain how we acquire knowledge, how knowledge relates to notions like justification, truth, and belief, and how and where it falls in the spectrum of certainty and error.
            </p>
          <h3>LOGIC</h3>
            <p>
              Logic is the branch of philosophy that studies reasoning. It teaches us how to differentiate between good and bad reasoning and how to construct valid arguments. It seeks answers to questions like, what is valid reasoning? How can you distinguish between a good argument and a bad argument? How can you spot fallacies or errors in an argument?

      <h2>Aristotelian Ethics: Philosophy Beyond Books</h2>
        <p>
          The highest good and the end toward which all human activity is directed is happiness, which can be defined as continuous contemplation of eternal and universal truth.
